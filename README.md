This repository contains the practicals for the _Foundations of Machine Learning_ training

## Librairies
These notebooks have been created with Python 3.13.2 and the following libraries:
* matplotlib 3.10.1
* numpy 2.2.4
* pandas 2.2.3
* scikit-learn 1.6.1

To use the same libraries, you can make use of the `package_list.yml` file:
* With Anaconda, follows the ["Importing an environment" tutorial](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/).
* With the command line, using [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (a fast replacement of conda with no licensing issues)
```bash
   mamba env create -f package_list.yml -n introml
   mamba activate introml
   pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

## Contenus
* Practical 1: getting started with `scikit-learn`
* Practical 2: model selection, regularization
* Practical 3: dimension reduction and clustering
* Practical 4: trees and ensemble models
* Practical 5: training neural networks


## Advanced use (git and nbstripout)
To facilitae version control with jupyter, please use [`nbstripout`](https://pypi.org/project/nbstripout/) to clean your notebooks before a commit,
```bash
nbstripout <notebook_name>.ipynb
```
`git diff <notebook_name>.ipynb` will help you check the changes made.
